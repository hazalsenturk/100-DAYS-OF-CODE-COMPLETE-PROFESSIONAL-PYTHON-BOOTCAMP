# Review: 
# Create a function called greet(). Simple function:
def greet():
# Write 3 print statements inside the function.
    print("Hello")
    print("How are you?")
    print("Isn't the weather nice today?")
# Call the greet() function and run your code.
greet()
#Function that allows input:

def greet_with_name(name):
  print(f"Hello {name}")
  print(f"How do you do {name}?")

greet_with_name("Hazal")
